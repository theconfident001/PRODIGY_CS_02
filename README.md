# Image Encryption and Decryption

This repository contains a Python script for encrypting and decrypting images using a simple mathematical operation. The encryption is done by manipulating pixel values with a key, and the decryption reverses the operation to restore the original image.

## Features

* Encrypts an image by applying a mathematical operation on pixel values.
* Decrypts the encrypted image using the reverse of the encryption operation.
* Ensures pixel values remain within the valid range of \[0, 255] after encryption and decryption.
* Saves and displays the encrypted and decrypted images.

## Requirements

* Python 3.x
* Pillow library (for image processing)
* NumPy library (for handling arrays)

## Installation

To get started, clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/image-encryption.git
cd image-encryption


Next, install the required dependencies:

bash
pip install Pillow numpy


## Usage

1. Place your image in the desired folder and specify its path in the image_path variable in the script.
2. Choose a key (an integer) for encryption and decryption. Modify the key variable in the script.
3. Run the script:

bash
python encrypt_decrypt_image.py


The script will:

* Encrypt the image and save it as encrypted_image.jpg.
* Decrypt the image and save it as decrypted_image.jpg.
* Display the encrypted and decrypted images.

## Example

For example, if the image is located at C:/Users/radha/OneDrive/Desktop/PRODIGY_CS_02/image.jpg and the key is 50, the script will:

* Encrypt the image by adding 50 to each pixel value.
* Decrypt the image by subtracting 50 from each pixel value.

## Files

* encrypt_decrypt_image.py: The main Python script for encryption and decryption.
* encrypted_image.jpg: The encrypted image file (generated after running the script).
* decrypted_image.jpg: The decrypted image file (restores the original image).
